<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![jSnake Screenshot](src/photos/Screenshot.jpg)

<b>Java Snake Game</b> is a simple snake game coded in Java.
The Java Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls
 a snake and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's 
 own tail. It is implemented using Java programming language and provides an 
 interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.Bug reports, suggestions and tips 
are always welcome!
You can help keep the jSnake hanging. Star this repository! ðŸŒŸ

### Features

* Snake Control: The player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) 
* Food Generation: Randomly positioned food appears on the game board, which the snake needs to eat to grow in size.
* Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
* Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail. The player can then see their final score and have the option to restart the game.
* Speed Adjustment: The game's speed gradually increases as the snake grows longer, providing an additional challenge for the player.
